# Keyvz: Keystroke visualizer

Key stroke that is pressed would be printed on the screen with a fade-out result.

It is mainly for personal use as I need a simple keystroke visualizer.

## Run

You will need rust, cargo and internet to build and run.

```
cargo run
```

Note that however, this application will need permission (at least on MacOS)
